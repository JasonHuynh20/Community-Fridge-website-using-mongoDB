# Community-Fridge-website-using-mongoDB
Community fridge website with an interactive cart. Website will update in real time and is connected to mongoDB and queried using express routes


IF ATTEMPT TO CLONE AND TRY IT OUT, YOU NEED TO HAVE A DATABASE ON MONGODB AND YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR OWN NODE.JS LOCALHOST SERVER SET UP. 
After, you need to go into the config.js file and change the server and database details to match your own


Initally, I built the client-side functionality of the application, to allow users to browse the list of fridges, browse items in a fridge, and pickup items from a fridge. 
In the second stage, I built the server-side component of the web application. Specifically, I created a Node.js server to serve all the resources associated with the application (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON). In addition to this, I also added persistence in my application. 
On the third stage, I built the assignment in Express, specifically focusing on building a REST API. 

In this completed and final stage, I connected the Express application to a MongoDB database. This involves moving all of the data from our JSON files into the MongoDB database and performing queries on this data.


In the end, what is left is a website that is connedted to express application to send website requests which is connected to MongoDB Database which stores the data
